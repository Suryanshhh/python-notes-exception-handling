I created this repository to store the basic but crucial concepts of exception handling in Python.
Everything is written in a simple, organized manner so I can understand the topic quickly and revisit it anytime.

This repo includes:

-Fundamentals of exception handling
-Difference between runtime and compile-time errors
-Types of errors
-Keywords used in exception handling
-A real-life example using a bank ATM machine

## Why this repo?
To document my progress and help others who are learning the same topics.
